# Gradient Boosting from scratch
## Introduction
This is an implementation of the Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm for regression and classification that I made for
learning purposes. The goal is recreating the core functionality in a simpler manner that makes the algorithm easier to
understand.

## Usage

The accompanying jupyter notebook shows basic usage for classification and regression.
